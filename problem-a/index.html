    <h5>Description</h5>
    <blockquote>
        <p> Dio Brando is a fictional character appearing in <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure">JoJo's Bizarre
                Adventure</a>, a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. He is the main
            antagonist of the
            series' first part, Phantom Blood, appearing in the debut chapter "Dio the Invader" (侵略者ディオ, Shinryakusha
            Dio),
            published in Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1987.[1] He later returns, known simply as DIO, as the main antagonist of
            the
            series' third part, Stardust Crusaders, now a powerful vampire and the user of the time-stopping Stand known
            as
            The World (ザ・ワールド, Za Wārudo).
        </p>
        <p> In the alternate universe of the series' seventh part, Steel Ball Run, a character named Diego Brando
            (ディエゴ・ブランドー, Diego Burandō) bearing a resemblance appears as a minor antagonist.

            The poor son of an abusive alcoholic who worked his mother to death, Dio holds an inordinate amount of
            enmity
            toward others. As the series' most prolific villain, his defining trait is his staunch ambition, which
            manifests
            in a peerless desire for power, no matter the cost.‎</p>
